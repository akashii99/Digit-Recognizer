# Digit-Recognizer

We have built a neural network for the MNIST dataset consisting of greyscale handwritten digits. While taking one of these images and predicting the digit in the image using PyTorch. We have used Softmax as the loss function and adam optimizer.
We have achieved an accuracy of over 98% and saved this model which can be used as a digit-recognizer.
